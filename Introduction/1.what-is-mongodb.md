# Mongo DB

**MongoDB**, the most popular NoSQL database which stores the data in form of key-value pairs.

> The term ‘NoSQL’ means **‘non-relational’**. It means that MongoDB isn’t based on the table-like relational database structure but provides an altogether different mechanism for storage and retrieval of data. This format of storage is called BSON ( similar to JSON format).

A simple MongoDB document Structure:

```json
{
  "title": "MongoDB",
  "type": "NoSQL",
  "has": ["DB", "Collections", "Documents"]
}
```

We can see, Documents are actually JSON representation of custom Objects.
