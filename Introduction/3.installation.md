# Install MongoDB

MongoDB offers both an Enterprise and Community version of its powerful distributed document database. We go ahead and install community version of MongoDB.

1. Go to the link https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community.
2. You see **Available Downloads** section.
3. Select the platform that you want to install in.
4. Click the download button.

After downloading, install it.

### Install MongoDB Shell

The **Mongo shell** is an interactive JavaScript interface to MongoDB. You can use the mongo shell to query and update data as well as perform administrative operations.

>Note: The mongo shell is included as part of the MongoDB server installation. If you have already installed the server, the mongo shell is installed to the same location as the server binary.

If you would like to download the mongo shell separately from the MongoDB Server, you can install the shell as a standalone package by following these steps:

1. Go to the link https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell
2. Select your preferred Version and Platform from the dropdowns.
3. Select the Package to download according to your platform
4. Download 

### Start the mongo Shell and Connect to MongoDB
Once you have downloaded the mongo shell, you can use it to connect to your running MongoDB server.
