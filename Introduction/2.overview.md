# Overview of MongoDB

MongoDB consists of a set of **databases**. Each database again consists of **Collections**. Data in MongoDB is stored in collections. Each Collection contains **Documents**. 

###  1. Database 
MongoDB stores data records as documents (specifically BSON documents) which are gathered together in collections. A database stores one or more collections of documents.

### 2. Collection
MongoDB stores documents in collections. Collections are analogous to tables in relational databases.

### 3. Documents
MongoDB stores data records as BSON documents. BSON is a binary representation of JSON documents, though it contains more data types than JSON.

Document Structure
MongoDB documents are composed of field-and-value pairs and have the following structure:

```
{
   field1: value1,
   field2: value2,
   field3: value3,
   ...
   fieldN: valueN
}
```
