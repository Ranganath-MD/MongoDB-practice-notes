# Read Operations

Read operations retrieve documents from a collection; i.e. query a collection for documents.

MongoDB provides the following methods to read documents from a collection:
`db.collection.find()`

You can specify query filters or criteria that identify the documents to return.

```
db.movies.find()
```
This method will return all the documents from a **marvel** collection that you have already inserted.

If you would like to find marvel movies which are released in 2008
(previously you added the movies into marvel collection)

`db.movies.find({ date: "2013" })
`
This will return all the records with matching criteria. viz.,

```
/* 1 */
{
    "_id" : ObjectId("60e5aced965b8be01d83918e"),
    "name" : "Thor: The Dark World",
    "date" : "2013"
}

/* 2 */
{
    "_id" : ObjectId("60e6fa46965b8be01d839190"),
    "name" : "Thor: The Dark World",
    "date" : "2013"
}

```
